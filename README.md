### Staking the Native Token

    Users stake their Zuri native token (ZURI) into a staking pool.
    They choose between flexible or fixed staking pools, which offer different reward rates.
    The tokens are locked for the chosen period, and rewards accumulate over time.

2. Earning Rewards Over Time

    Users earn staking rewards in ZURI tokens based on the poolâ€™s APY (Annual Percentage Yield).
    The longer they stake, the higher the rewards they accumulate.

3. Reconvert Staked Tokens & Rewards into a Pegged Crypto

    After the staking period ends, users can choose to reconvert their ZURI tokens and rewards into a stablecoin (e.g., USDT, USDC) before withdrawing.
    This process is managed through:
        An internal liquidity pool that allows token swaps between ZURI and the pegged crypto.
        A decentralized exchange (DEX) integration that offers real-time conversion.
        A smart contract-based auto-conversion system that executes the swap instantly upon withdrawal.

4. Withdrawing the Converted Crypto

    Once the ZURI tokens & rewards are swapped to USDT/USDC, the user can withdraw to their external wallet.
    This ensures that users lock in their earnings in a stable form, avoiding price volatility risks.

Why This System is Beneficial:

âœ… Protects users from volatility â€“ Stakers can convert rewards into a stable asset before withdrawing.
âœ… Encourages long-term staking â€“ Users feel more secure knowing they can easily reconvert their earnings.
âœ… Ensures liquidity â€“ A properly managed liquidity pool ensures that users can always swap their tokens.
âœ… Simplifies cashing out â€“ Users can withdraw directly in a pegged crypto rather than handling multiple transactions.
Possible Implementations:

    Integrated Swap Feature â€“ A built-in swap that converts ZURI to USDT/USDC via an automated liquidity pool.
    Multi-Token Reward Option â€“ Users choose whether they want staking rewards in ZURI or directly in a stablecoin.
    Auto-Conversion Option â€“ Users can enable an auto-convert feature, where their earned rewards automatically swap into a pegged crypto at predefined intervals.
